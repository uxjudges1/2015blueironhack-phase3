Currently the website is not working.

Due to time constrains, I just put the google map on it and d3.

I will continue to implement it by importing the data from data.gov and some data from purdue police department. And show these data on the map with overlays to give some dart charts about the historical events happened on the map and some other factors like police station, recreation, parks coverage range.

You could run the application by first do a npm install and bower install to get all the dependencies and then run grunt serve to run the server.

Unit test cases are not written yet.
